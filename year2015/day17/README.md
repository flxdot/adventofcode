## \--- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---

The elves bought too much eggnog again - `150` liters this time. To fit it all
into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You
take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.

For example, suppose you have containers of size `20`, `15`, `10`, `5`, and
`5` liters. If you need to store `25` liters, there are four ways to do it:

  * `15` and `10`
  * `20` and `5` (the first `5`)
  * `20` and `5` (the second `5`)
  * `15`, `5`, and `5`

Filling all containers entirely, how many different _combinations of
containers_ can exactly fit all `150` liters of eggnog?
