# Advent of Code 2020

Little repo to track my progress of the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com).

The task descriptions are placed into the module or package docstring, the inputs are placed
as txt files in the `inputs` folder.

Here are the links to the individual implementations of each day:

* [Day 1](day1.py)
* [Day 2](day2.py)
